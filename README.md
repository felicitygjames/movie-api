# movie-api

This project is a REST-ful API built with Node and Express, and provides information about several movies that I selected. 

I built it as part of the second achievement in my CareeFoundry course.

It uses Passport and JavaScript Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate and authorize a user, provided they include their information correctly. 

The server is hosted on Heroku and the database was built using MongoDB.

As part of the CareerFoundry course, two client-side projects were built for this API, the first using React and the second using Angular. You can find links to both the react and angular versions on my github page.
